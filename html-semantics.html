    <h1>HMTL Semantics</h1>

    <p>HMTL has changed since HTML5 came around.  The semantics of HTML5 back up what HTML already offered in terms of capability.  Though HTML5 made "center" "font" and "big" obsolete, having them in web browsers still won't affect them and the browsers should still work, though they're from before HTML5.  Be aware of the "frame" element is not in HTML5, so if I have to use it, I should use another "DOCTYPE" so my webpage still works.  Things like presentation elements, such as "small" doesn't mean "use a small font" in represents side comments, like small print.  There are also new semantics, such as "header" "footer" "nav" and "section".</p>

    <p>Relationships between signs and symbols are studied as semantics.  HTML elements, attributes and attribute values are important in front-end development. The principles of writing for front-end development in semantics are related to what is read and needs to be read in a finished webpage. But not all semantics are built because of the finish content.</p>
