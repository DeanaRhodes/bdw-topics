    <h1>HTML Repaint</h1>

    <p>Repaint, or redraw, happens when something you could not see before can be seen now or reversed.  For example, a repaint happens when you add an outline to an element or change something in the background, like the color, or another change seen visibly.  Repaint are expensive for the browser to run, so the less repaints you do the better because if affects DOM.  Almost every time you repaint the HTML, and in return affect the DOM structure, you trigger a reflow.</p>

    <p>The majority of the time, you will start with an existing page with a paint and change it later.  This repaint can not only be expensive but it can hurt the user experience, because the user interface may appear as being sluggish or slow.  If a repaint is necessary, the page will have to be updated from the background forward, starting possibly with the background color.</p>
