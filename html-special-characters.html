    <h1>HMTL Special Characters</h1>

    <p>Characters vary when used to represent different languages. Letters, numbers and symbols all vary within languages, such as a &uuml; in German. This special character is called a diacritic. Punctuations, symbols, and diacritics make up the ISO Latin or HTML entities.  Since HTML5, the special characters list has changed slightly since HTML 3.2.</p>

    <p>Special characters, such as &copy; or &reg; can be easily entered into code as long as the code is typed correctly. There are many special characters, so there is always going to be code for a special character you're looking for.</p>
