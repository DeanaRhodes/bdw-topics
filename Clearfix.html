    <p> What is Clearfix?  Clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear itself so that additional markups are not necessary.  It's used in float layouts and helps to combat the zero-height container problem.  This helps solve floated elements that may be collapsed or become collapsed. </P>

    <p>The problem with clear fix happens when a floated element is inside a container box, the height will not automatically change.  To create a semantic clearfix it has to include all of the elements you want to fix around parent element of the float collapse.  The CSS reads this element without completely changing the outline.</p>
